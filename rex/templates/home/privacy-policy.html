                       </p>
                       <p>
                          6.4. We will not be responsible or liable to you for any loss and take no responsibility for and will not be liable to you for any use of our

                       <p>
                          7.1. You agree to hold harmless The Best Token (and each of our officers, directors, members, employees, agents and affiliates) from any claim,
                          demand, action, damage, loss, cost or expense, including without limitation reasonable legal fees, arising out or relating to:
                       </p>
                       <p>7.1.1. Your use of, or conduct in connection with, our Services;</p>
                       <p>7.1.2. Any feedback or submissions you provide (see 19 below);</p>
                       <p>7.1.3. Your violation of these Terms; or</p>
                       <p>7.1.4. Violation of any rights of any other person or entity.</p>
                       <p>
                          7.2. If you are obligated to indemnify us, we will have the right, in our sole discretion, to control any action or proceeding (at our expense)
                          and determine whether we wish to settle it.
                       </p>
                       <h4>8. NO LIABILITY FOR THIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT</h4>
                       <p>
                          8.1. In using our Services, you may view content or utilize services provided by third parties, including links to web pages and services
                          of such parties (“Third Party Content”). We do not control, endorse or adopt any Third-Party Content and will have no responsibility for
                          Third Party Content including, without limitation, material that may be misleading, incomplete, erroneous, offensive, indecent or otherwise
                          objectionable in your jurisdiction. In addition, your dealings or correspondence with such third parties are solely between you and the third
                          parties. We are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as a result of any such dealings and you understand that
                          your use of Third Party Content, and your interactions with third parties, is at your own risk.
                       </p>
                       <h4>9. WALLET REGISTRATION</h4>
                       <p>
                          9.1. You need not use a The Best Token Wallet. If you wish to use the Wallet, you must create a wallet with The Best Token to access the Services
                          (“Wallet”). When you create a Wallet, you are strongly advised to take the following precautions, as failure to do so may result in loss of
                          access to, and/or control over, your Wallet: (a) Create a strong password that you do not use for any other website or online service; (b)
                          Provide accurate and truthful information; (c) Maintain and promptly update your Wallet information; (d) maintain the security of your Wallet
                          by protecting your Wallet password and access to your computer and your Wallet; (e) Promptly notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect
                          any security breaches related to your Wallet (f) use the backup functionality provided by the Wallet and safeguard your backup files as you
                          would safeguard your most important personal information.
                       </p>
                       <p>9.2. When you create a Wallet, we will assign you an identifier that you must retain to access your Wallet.</p>
                       <p>
                          9.3. You hereby accept and acknowledge that you take responsibility for all activities that occur under your Wallet and accept all risks of
                          any authorized or unauthorized access to your Wallet, to the maximum extent permitted by law.
                       </p>
                       <h4>10. THE The Best Token SERVICES</h4>
                       <p>
                          10.1. As described in more detail below, the Services, among other things, provide in-browser (or otherwise local) software that (a) generates
                          and stores Virtual Currency Wallet Addresses and encrypted Private Keys (defined below), and (b) Facilitates the submission of Virtual
                          Currency transaction data to the relevant Virtual Currency The Best Token network without requiring you to download or install the associated
                          Virtual Currency network software to your local device.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          10.2. Wallet Address and Private Key and Backup Phrase. When you create a Wallet, the Services generate and store a cryptographic private
                          and public key pair that you may use to send and receive any supported Virtual Currency via the relevant Virtual Currency network. An encrypted
                          backup of certain information associated with the Wallet is stored by the Services. The Private Key uniquely matches the Wallet Address and must
                          be used in connection with the Wallet Address to authorize the transfer of Virtual Currency from that Wallet Address. You are solely responsible
                          for maintaining the security of your Private Key and any backup phrase associated with your wallet. You must keep your Wallet Address, backup
                          phrase and Private Key access information secure. Failure to do so may result in the loss of control of Virtual Currency associated with the
                          Wallet.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          10.3. No Password Retrieval. The Best Token does not receive or store your Wallet password, nor the unencrypted keys and addresses. Therefore,
                          we cannot assist you with Wallet password retrieval. Our Services provide you with tools to help you remember or recover your password,
                          including by allowing you to set password hints, but the Services cannot generate a new password for your Wallet. You are solely responsible
                          for remembering your Wallet password. If you have not safely stored a backup of any Wallet Addresses and Private Key pairs maintained in your
                          Wallet, you accept and acknowledge that any Virtual Currency you have associated with such Wallet Addresses will become inaccessible if you do
                          not have your Wallet password.

                       <p>
                          10.4. Transactions. In order to be completed, all proposed Virtual Currency transactions must be confirmed and recorded in the Virtual Currency
                          public ledger associated with the relevant Virtual Currency network. Such networks are decentralized, peer-to-peer networks supported by
                          independent third-parties, which are not owned, controlled or operated by The Best Token. Virtual Currency networks are operated by decentralized
                          networks of independent third parties. The Best Token has no control over any Virtual Currency network and therefore cannot and does not ensure
                          that any transaction details you submit via the Services will be confirmed via the relevant Virtual Currency network. You acknowledge and agree
                          that the transaction details you submit via the Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the Virtual Currency network
                          used to process the transaction.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          10.5. No Storage or Transmission of Virtual Currency. A Virtual Currency is an intangible, digital asset. They exist only by virtue of the
                          ownership record maintained in the underlying Virtual Currency network. The Services do not store, send or receive Virtual Currency. Any
                          transfer of title that might occur in any Virtual Currency occurs on the decentralized ledger within the Virtual Currency network and not
                          within the Services. We do not guarantee that the Service can affect the transfer of title or right in any Virtual Currency.
                       </p>
                       <p>

                          you and The Best Token being with respect to one another independent contractors.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          10.7. Accuracy of Information. You represent and warrant that any information you provide via the Services is accurate and complete. You accept
                          and acknowledge that The Best Token is not responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any Virtual Currency transaction
                          initiated via the Services, for instance, if you mistype a Wallet Address or otherwise provide incorrect information. We strongly encourage you
                          to review your transaction details carefully before completing them via the Services.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          10.8. No Cancellations or Modifications. Once transaction details have been submitted to the Virtual Currency network via the Services, the
                          Services cannot assist you to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction details. The Best Token has no control over any Virtual Currency
                          network and does not have the ability to facilitate any cancellation or modification requests.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                          10.9. Taxes. It is your responsibility to determine what, if any, taxes apply to the transactions you for which you have submitted transaction
                          details via the Services, and it is your responsibility to report and remit the correct tax to the appropriate tax authority. You agree that
                          The Best Token is not responsible for determining whether taxes apply to your Virtual Currency transactions or for collecting, reporting,
                          withholding or remitting any taxes arising from any Virtual Currency transactions.
                       </p>

                       <p>
                          11.1. Company Fees Creating a Wallet is free. The Best Token does not currently charge fees for any Services, however we reserve the right to do
                          so in future, and in such case any applicable fees will be displayed prior to you using any Service to which a fee applies.
                       </p>
                       <h4>12. MINERS FEES</h4>
                       <p>
                          12.1. Overview of Virtual Currency Mining. A Virtual Currency network is a network of computers operated by individuals or entities known as
                          “miners,” who voluntarily participate in the process of confirming transactions on the network. These computers (known as “mining rigs”)
                          compile a list or “block” of pending transactions, verify that each transaction in the block is valid and does not involve an attempt to
                          double-spend coins, and attempt to complete a mathematical algorithm that determines whether the block may be added to the public ledger
                          of confirmed blocks, called the “The Best Token.” Typically, miners receive: (i) an amount of Virtual Currency as a reward for any confirmed
                          transaction, generated automatically via the Virtual Currency mining protocol; and (ii) Any fees voluntarily included within the block by
                          the individuals who initiated the proposed transactions (“Miners Fees”). Since miners verify Virtual Currency transactions on a voluntary
                          basis, it is customary to include a Miners Fee in order to provide an incentive to the miners to add a proposed transaction to the next block
                          for confirmation via the Virtual Currency network.
                       </p>
                       <h4>13. DEFAULT MINERS FEE</h4>
                       <p>
                          13.1. For Bitcoin, you may choose between three Miners Fee settings: (i) Default, (ii) High and (iii) Custom. For Ethereum, The Best Token will
                          determine a default Miners Fee. You accept and acknowledge that The Best Token does not receive any Miners Fees in connection with providing the
                          Services, and is not responsible for the speed at which your transactions may be verified by miners.
                       </p>
                       <h4>14. NO RIGHT TO CANCEL The Best Token SERVICES OR MINERS FEES</h4>
                       <p>
                          14.1. If you use a Service to which a charge applies, or you initiate a transaction with a Miners Fee via the Services, you will not be able
                          to change your mind once you have confirmed that you wish to proceed with the Service or transaction.
                       </p>
